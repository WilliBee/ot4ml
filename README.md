**Optimal Transport for Machine Learners**

This repository contains materials for a course on Optimal Transport for Machine Learning.

## Python Resources

In the `python/` directory, you will find the following Jupyter notebooks:

- [Optimal Transport with Linear Programming](python/1-linprog.ipynb)
- [Entropic Regularization of Optimal Transport](python/2-sinkhorn.ipynb)
- [Advanced Topics on Sinkhorn Algorithm](python/3-sinkhorn-advanced.ipynb)
- [Semi-discrete Optimal Transport](python/4-semidiscrete.ipynb)
- [Unbalanced Optimal Transport](python/5-unbalanced.ipynb)
- [Diffusion models and Optimal Transport](python/6-diffusion.ipynb)

To open these notebooks in **Google Colab**, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gpeyre/ot4ml).
2. Navigate to the `python/` folder.
3. Click on the notebook you want to open.
4. Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook preview, or manually replace `github.com` with `colab.research.google.com/github` in the URL to open it in Colab.

Example:  
To open `python/1-linprog.ipynb`, go to  
`https://github.com/gpeyre/ot4ml/blob/main/python/1-linprog.ipynb`  
and replace it with  
`https://colab.research.google.com/github/gpeyre/ot4ml/blob/main/python/1-linprog.ipynb`
